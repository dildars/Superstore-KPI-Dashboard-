What is Tableau ? 

Tableau software is one of the fastest growing data visualization tools which is currently being used in the Business intelligence industry. It is the best way to change or transform the raw set of data into an easily understandable format with zero technical skills and coding knowledge.

Overview

Dashboard where we can track how well company is doing for previous years (in terms of Sales, Profit and Quantity Sold), and also like to know how well categories are performing in different regions.

I have used xls files from which I have created a Dashboard for the quick review so that owner could take further decisions for the benefit of the company.

Thus, I have created below interactive dashboard as per the requirement and  could switch and view different shipping stats for different  years.
